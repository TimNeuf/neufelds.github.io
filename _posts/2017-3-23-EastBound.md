## Family and Friends, 

Because of our increasing geographic distance, we thought it would be a good idea to update everyone on our lives. 

Tim and I have both been attending school this past year, which is always demanding, and quite busy. Along with school, I have been working, and we have still been fostering dogs! We were reunited with Teddy (my cat) this year, which was exciting.

I have successfully made the house a zoo on numerous occasions, currently with a large turtle we are taking care of. I continue to remind Tim he was warned of this happening! 

In school I have been taking general studies, so a bunch of random intro courses, mainly in science and math. Tim is finishing up the academic portion of his Bachelor of Theology degree this year at Ambrose University. 

The final part of his degree involves taking part in an internship. Through prayer and searching for something that will work for both of us, God is sending us to the East Coast. We are moving to Truro, NS! In Truro, I will be attending Dalhousie University for a BSc. in Agriculture and Animal Science. Tim will be interning with Scott Penner at the Alliance Church in Truro. 

We are both extremely excited for this change in our life, and are looking forward to seeing where God takes us from here. This is a significant life change for us, and we would like to ask for your support in prayer.

### Please pray that we can:

- Develop new and fruitful relationships
- Continue to connect with friends and family
- Have safe moving travels with Rhonda the Honda and the zoo
- Raise $300 a month for the Atlantic Development Fund (that sponsors Tim’s Internship)
- Find Jobs – Tim’s internship is 5 months long, but he will need to find a job after that. I will also need to find a job for summer.

Thank you for your continued support!
